# Interface parity browser harness

This test-only harness exercises the original Galactic Information Display (GID)
menu and 38 deterministic states, for both factions at 640×480 and a letterboxed
1280×800 viewport. It launches a new pinned Chrome for Testing process for
each case with audio muted. The fixture bridge exists only in the separate
`interface-test-fixtures` WASM build. Production HTML and WASM are checked for
fixture imports and markers.

From this directory, install the pinned Node packages with `npm ci`, then run:

```sh
node run.mjs --smoke        # build both WASM variants; four quick cases
node run.mjs --all          # rebuild; all 152 faction/viewport cases
node run.mjs --all --no-build  # reuse a verified fixture build
node run.mjs --all --scenario=pan --no-build  # four focused faction/viewport cases
```

The runner expects the exact Chrome for Testing version in `browser.json`.
Set `OPEN_REBELLION_CHROME_FOR_TESTING` to its executable if it is installed
elsewhere. The build needs the local owned game data, the wasm32 Rust target,
and the tools used by `scripts/build-wasm.sh`. The runner serves only on
127.0.0.1. Screenshots, complete browser console/cache diagnostics, resource hashes, interaction probes,
four-request ledgers, and results go to the ignored
`.artifacts/interface-parity/<run-id>/` directory. Failed cases exit nonzero.

The PNG comparison directory contains *implementation regression* baselines,
not original-game truth. `--update-goldens` creates only missing implementation
baselines, never overwrites a mismatch, and requires an accepted, SHA-verified
original source in `baselines/accepted-original.json`. A passing browser run without
original lossless captures does not complete a strict interface-parity cell.
At native 640x480, every run also checks all nine Message Index rail icons
pixel-for-pixel against the corresponding original STRATEGY BMPs. This proves
resting-art identity only, not the unread states or Message Index interactions.
The runner compares captured menu, hover, legend, and pan/zoom states as well as
the initial frame once each state has its own reviewed original reference and
implementation regression baseline. Until then their comparison is recorded as
`unbaselined`, not an assertion of visual fidelity.
